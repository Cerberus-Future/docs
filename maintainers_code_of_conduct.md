# Maintainers conduct notes:

The maintainers:

1 - Mustn't insult, use hate words, do personal attacks or any action that is unacceptable towards the creation of a positive environment with the team. 

2 - Mustn't do any unofficial modifications without prior permission.

3 - Must upload:

3.1 - Theirs trees on [Cerberus-Devices](https://github.com/Cerberus-Devices) organization. The trees should fully reflect the changes when a new build is pushed for that specific device tree(s). Last but not the least, it should be fully buildable.

3.2 - Changelogs for each build.

4 - Must test every build before sending to user.

5 - Must ship the 10 Edition builds twice in month.

6 - Must keep authorship of git commits that are pushed, mandatory for all repository. Force-pushes are acceptable.
